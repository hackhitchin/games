Games for a 240x64 display (such as the one at Hitchin Hackspace)
=================================================================

Slide
-----

Sliding blocks game that for legal reasons is not the one you're thinking
of. And it goes sideways.

Keys:

* Up arrow:     Move shape up
* Down arrow:   Move shape down
* Left arrow:   Slide shape rapidly to the left
* Space:        Rotate shape

It should also work with joysticks/gamepads, though I only have one to test
with.

Score:
* 1 line:       1 point
* 2 lines:      3 points
* 3 lines:      5 points
* 4 lines:      8 points

The game gets progressively faster every 20 points

Prerequisite python modules (pip3 install ...):
* pygame
* numpy
